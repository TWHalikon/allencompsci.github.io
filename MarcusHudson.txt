This is Marcus' Journal, if you are reading this I question why you are here, unless you are Mr. Ben-Yaakov.

This is an example entry of my journal so I don't have to worry later about making it look fancy, or something like that. 

Journal Entry #1 4/18/2019
I am special, that is not exactly the best thing in the world. I will likely need to rewrite the code due to my lack of organization
in writing the first project of the game. The beginning of the game works just fine, however it's not exactly set up properly
and it's hard to follow. This will take some time likely, I might work on something this weekend to try and improve my own
writing/code. The variables are just letters, there's no function cause I didn't really know about them back then, and the
skip line part has potato next to it all the time. I think that's just a placeholder, however it distracts me. I should write more
journal stuff, this is kind of fun talking to myself and I get to vent about everything I dislike in what I'm doing. 
Today, Marcus learned how to critique himself. What an achievement.
